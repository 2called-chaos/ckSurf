This is a basic replay pack that you can use on maps, that no one has completed on your server yet. The quality of the bots varies, and they are not guaranteed to be 100% perfect.

To install the record bots, move the cKreplays folder to your csgo/addons/sourcemod/data/ folder, but be sure to not overwrite the files in csgo/addons/sourcemod/data/cKreplays, if you don't want to lose your own bots!

These record bots will be overwritten when someone beats the map on your server, regardless of if the time is better than the bots time.
